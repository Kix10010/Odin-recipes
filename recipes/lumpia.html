    <h4>A Filipino Appetizer</h4>
        <p>Lumpiang Shanghai is <em>the life of every Filipino party</em>—crispy, golden, and dangerously easy to devour by the dozen. These <strong>bite-sized spring rolls</strong> are packed with a savory mixture of ground meat, finely chopped vegetables, and simple seasonings, all tightly wrapped in thin lumpia wrappers and <em>fried to crunchy perfection</em>. Each piece delivers that irresistible contrast of a shatter-crisp exterior and a juicy, flavorful filling inside. Dip it in <em>sweet chili sauce</em> (or banana ketchup if you’re feeling extra Filipino), and don’t be surprised when the plate disappears in minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> despite the name <em>“Shanghai,”</em> Lumpiang Shanghai is proudly Filipino and has become a must-have dish at birthdays, holidays, and family gatherings across the Philippines. The smaller size is actually intentional—it’s <strong>designed to be the ultimate finger food</strong>, perfect for sharing (or secretly hoarding). Many Filipino families even turn lumpia-rolling into a full-on assembly line event before big celebrations, proving that <em>the real secret ingredient of Lumpiang Shanghai is teamwork—and maybe a little friendly competition over who rolls the neatest batch</em>.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h5>Filling:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb (450 g) Ground Pork</li>
            <li>1 Small Carrot, very finely minced</li>
            <li>1/2 Small onion, very finely minced</li>
            <li>3 cloves Garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Ground Black Pepper</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Green Onions, finely chopped (optional, but tasty)</li>
        </ul>
    <h5>Wrapping and Frying:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>30 - 40 Spring Roll Wrappers</li>
            <li>Water (for sealing the wrappers)</li>
            <li>Neutral cooking Oil (enough for deep or shallow frying)</li>
        </ul>
    <h5>Dipping Sauce (Don't Skip This!):</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Sweet Chili Sauce</li>
            <li>Banana Ketchup</li>
        </ul>        
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground pork, carrot, onion, garlic, egg, soy sauce, salt, pepper, and green onions (if using). Mix until everything is well combined—but don’t overmix, or the filling can get dense. Think: combined and happy, not overworked.</li>
            <li>Separate the lumpia wrappers and keep them covered with a slightly damp cloth so they don’t dry out. Place one wrapper on a clean surface in a diamond shape (one corner pointing at you).</li>
            <li>Spoon about 1–2 tablespoons of filling near the bottom corner. Shape it into a small log. Fold the bottom corner over the filling, tuck in the sides, and roll upward tightly. Dab a little water on the top corner to seal. Repeat until you’ve got a beautiful army of lumpia.</li>
            <li>In a deep pan, heat about 1–2 inches of oil over medium heat until it reaches about 350°F (175°C). No thermometer? Dip the end of a wrapper in—if it sizzles right away, you’re good to go.</li>
            <li>Carefully add the lumpia in batches—don’t overcrowd the pan. Fry for about 3–5 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crispy. Your kitchen will smell like a Filipino party.</li>
            <li>Remove the lumpia and place them on a paper towel-lined plate or rack to drain excess oil. Let them cool slightly (they’re lava-hot inside!).</li>
            <li>Arrange on a platter and serve with sweet chili sauce and/or banana ketchup for dipping. Warning: you may want to hide a few pieces for yourself.</li>
            <h5>Fun tip: Lumpiang Shanghai freezes beautifully before frying—make a big batch now and thank your future self later.</h5>
