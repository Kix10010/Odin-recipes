The Odin Project Recipe Portfolio

This will be the first project on my personal portfolio for future job applications and references.
It will show my basic knowledge of HTML5 and corresponding skills. This will measure how far I have come as a self-paced learner and how creative I am in maximizing the very limited knowledge of a complete beginner. 

In this project, I will attempt to build a basic recipe website which will include basic HTML syntax and semantic tags. Additionaly, this will showcase my current understanding of attributes and elements, links and images, and basic logic.

I will make it a point to come back to this project as my knowledge in Web Development grows. My goal is to complete this project from top-to-bottom and make it as stylistic and interactive as professionals will have it. 

This will be my first in the many that will come.
